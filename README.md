# Control systems overview   
### this documents explains the fundamental classical control algorithms used in robotics and automation-focusing on how they process error signals to stabiliz or control system.
- P (Proportional)
- PI (Proportional-Integral)
- PD (Proportional-Derivative)
- PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)

## 1. P Controller (Proportional Control)
the proportional controller produces an output that is directly proportional to the current error between the desired setpoint and sensor value process variable
